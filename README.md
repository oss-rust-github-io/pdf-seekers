## Key Features:
- Indexing capability on single PDF file or directory containing multiple PDF files
- Search for keywords across multiple PDF files to get relevant information
- Get number of pages in PDF file, the page numbers containing the search term, and surrounding text aroung the search term

## Python

**Installation**

Install the latest pypdf-seekers version with:
`pip install pypdf-seekers`

Releases happen quite often (weekly / every few days) at the moment, so updating polars regularly to get the latest bugfixes / features might not be a bad idea.

### Usage Examples

```
>>> import pypdf_seekers as ps
>>>        
>>> data_dir = "data"
>>> index_dir = "index"
>>> search_term = "convolutional"
>>> 
>>> ps.indexing_contents(data_dir, index_dir)
