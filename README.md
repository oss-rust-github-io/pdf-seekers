## Key Features:
- Indexing capability on single PDF file or directory containing multiple PDF files
- Search for keywords across multiple PDF files to get relevant information
- Get number of pages in PDF file, the page numbers containing the search term, and surrounding text aroung the search term

## Python

**Installation**

Install the latest pypdf-seekers version with:
`pip install pypdf-seekers`

Releases happen quite often (weekly / every few days) at the moment, so updating pypdf-seekers regularly to get the latest bugfixes / features might not be a bad idea.

### Usage Examples

```
>>> import pypdf_seekers as ps
>>>
>>> data_dir = "data"
>>> cache_path = None
>>> log_level = "debug"
>>> search_term = "convolutional"
>>>                   
>>> ps.indexing_contents(data_dir, cache_path, log_level)

- **-f, --file-or-directory**: Provide single PDF file to be searched, or directory path containing multiple PDF files
- **-s, --search-term**: Keyword to be searched in PDF files (only required when action=Searching)
- **-c, --cache-path**: Directory path where all indexed files, log files, and tracker files will be stored If no value is provided, then this will be created in current working directory
- **-l, --log-level**: Flag to indicate verbosity level for logs Default value is set to Info. Allowed values are INFO, WARN, DEBUG, ERROR, TRACE, OFF
